Pregnancy proceeded normally and mother gave birth to a healthy boy born in incomplete breech position.

Arc/partus/2099: Patient 2q024.24D (multiparous) labored for 11 hours in climate controlled birthing pod in a techno-agricultural commune in Groningen, virtually attended to and assisted by by a midwife through holography technology. Parent self-admitted anesthetics through robotically inserted IV and gave birth to a girl. 

Arc/antinat/2103: Patient 2342.10D a cyborg-human hybrid unexpectedly presented with a pregnancy, which was assumed impossible due to genetic blockage of (the formation of) sex cells in all cyborg-human lineages.
